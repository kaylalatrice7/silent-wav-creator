Requirement: 5 GB of free memory (swap is fine)

Put your intentions in "intention.txt", I use conceptual ones like: "Brain is producing Evolved Mind Pattern". Once saved, run "create.bat". The utility will create a silent one-minute WAV file from your intentions (with WAV Converter) and charge it with Intention Repeater MAX.

Suggestion on usage of the produced files:

Preferably, open the files with VLC Media Player. Go to VLC Properties > disable "Use only one instance with file manager" and disable "Use systray icon."
Turn on repeat mode, then close it. All files you open next will be in repeat mode and in their own instances.

Mix and match different files to create your perfect energy blend.
Try renaming the files to add your name as a suffix for a remote broadcast (unconfirmed method):
"wealth (John Smith).wav" for example if your name is "John Smith."
Leave the PC running with the files on repeat and it should broadcast to you remotely.

The more files you open, the stronger the energy fields get, I hypothesize. You can open several of the same file also.
